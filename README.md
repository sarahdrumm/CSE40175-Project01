## Manifesto:

We are **_ND_**. We are passionate. We are educated. We are identical.

**_Nothing Divides_** us, as we code to achieve our common goal. Pursuing our desires we solve problems through innovation, ingenuity, and integrity. Developing new ideas, we seek to leave the world better than we found it. Novel ideas are respected and pursued with intent. Every decision is made in the best interest of our community and the people we serve.

**_Never Distinguished_**, we accept our accolades in silence. Our reward is the knowledge we obtain. Knowledge that will be given back to the community. Knowledge that will be used for the greater good. Knowledge that will empower the weak. Knowledge that will give purpose to all who seek it. 

**_Nothing Deters_** us, after our goal is set we move to acheive it. Try and stop us. Give us hurdles, we know how to jump. Give us rules, we know how to break them. Give us a problem, and we will solve it. 

**_Never Die_**, our creations extend past ourselves. We write with the pen of the future, not dulled by time, our code will outlive us all. With passion and purpose we dedicate our lives to the craft, so that our products will succeed us.

We are many, but we are all **_ND_**.
